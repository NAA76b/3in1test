# MASTER 3in1 Tool v2 - Modern Edition

A completely redesigned version of the MASTER 3in1 Tool with a modern Apple/Google-style UI and enhanced employee ID matching capabilities.

## 🎨 Key Improvements

### UI/UX Enhancements
- **Modern Design**: Clean, light theme inspired by Apple and Google design systems
- **Step-by-Step Workflow**: Numbered steps with visual progress indicators
- **Responsive Layout**: Two-column design with controls on left, logs on right
- **Interactive Elements**: Hover effects, smooth transitions, and dynamic field states
- **Summary Badges**: Real-time statistics display with color-coded results

### Technical Improvements
- **Centralized Logic**: 
  - `normalize_name()` function for consistent name matching
  - `format_output_filename()` for standardized file naming
  - Safe wrappers for file and COM operations
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: 
  - Non-blocking error messages
  - Graceful fallbacks for missing dependencies
  - Thread-safe UI updates
- **Bug Fixes**:
  - Fixed HTML CSS syntax error (line 789 in original)
  - Improved header detection logic
  - Better handling of edge cases

### Employee ID Matching Feature
- **Smart Matching Algorithm**:
  - Exact match on normalized names
  - Fuzzy matching with configurable threshold (60-100%)
  - Preserves existing employee IDs
- **Comprehensive Reporting**:
  - Match status for each employee
  - Summary statistics
  - Export to Excel with all details

## 📋 Requirements

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Key dependencies:
- pandas >= 1.3.0
- fuzzywuzzy >= 0.18.0
- pywin32 >= 301 (Windows only, for Outlook integration)
- python-docx >= 0.8.11
- openpyxl >= 3.0.9

## 🚀 Usage

### Employee ID Matcher (New Feature)

1. **Select Employee Lookup File**: Choose the "Jan 2025 names" file containing employee IDs
2. **Select History Files**: Choose files with employee names needing ID matching
3. **Configure Matching**: Adjust the fuzzy match threshold (default: 85%)
4. **Generate Report**: Creates `Master_Names_with_IDs_[timestamp].xlsx`

### Output Format

The matched Excel file contains:
- **Source**: Original data source (Helper vs Inactive)
- **Original Columns**: All data from input file
- **Original_Employee_ID**: Existing ID if present
- **Matched_Employee_ID**: ID from lookup file
- **Match_Status**: One of:
  - "Exact match"
  - "Fuzzy match (X% confidence)"
  - "Already had ID"
  - "No match found"

### Match Statistics

The tool provides real-time statistics:
- **Exact Matches** (Green): Perfect name matches
- **Fuzzy Matches** (Yellow): Close matches above threshold
- **No Matches** (Red): Names that couldn't be matched
- **Existing IDs** (Blue): Records that already had employee IDs

### Design Patterns

1. **Separation of Concerns**: UI, business logic, and data processing are clearly separated
2. **Error Resilience**: All external operations wrapped in try/except blocks
3. **Thread Safety**: UI updates always routed through `root.after()`
4. **Configurability**: Key parameters (thresholds, paths) are user-configurable

## 📊 Performance

- Handles large datasets (10,000+ employees) efficiently
- Fuzzy matching optimized with python-Levenshtein
- Non-blocking UI during processing
- Memory-efficient pandas operations

## 🐛 Known Issues & Limitations

1. Outlook integration requires Windows and pywin32
2. Fuzzy matching accuracy depends on name quality
3. Excel file size limited by available memory

## 🔄 Migration from v1

The tool maintains backward compatibility while adding new features:
- All original functionality preserved
- Existing workflows continue to work
- New Employee ID Matcher is additive
